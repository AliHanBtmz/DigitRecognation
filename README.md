# Brief Summary
<p>The main goal of the project was to develop a model that accuratelyclassifies handwritten digits. I trained the model using the MNISTdataset and the CNN algorithm. I trained and tested the model for digitrecognition. Later on, I integrated this model with image processingtechniques to create a project that recognizes digits in real-time.</p>

The digit recognition project report is coming soon...
