# DIGIT RECOGNITION
## ABSTRACT
<p>I trained the model to investigate digit recognition using the CNN algorithm with the Mnist dataset. MNIST is one of the common datasets used to train models to recognize handwritten numbers. The data set contains 10 data sets from 0 to 9. I used CNN because it is a very successful algorithm in image classification.</p>
<br>

## DATASET
<p>The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is created to recognize individual digits. The MNIST dataset had created by remixing some datasets of the NIST . In the MNIST dataset we have 70000 images of handwritten numbers resized to 28Ã—28 and converted to grayscale </p>
